Welcome to Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services. The lecture you just watched
focused on three architecting courses. These courses introduce you to the comprehensive and
flexible infrastructure and platform services provided by Google Cloud, with a focus on Compute
Engine:

1. Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation
*2. Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Core Services (this course)*
3. Elastic Cloud Infrastructure: Scaling and Automation

This course builds on the Essential Cloud Infrastructure: Foundation course and enhances your
study of architecting with Compute Engine. In this course, we start by talking about Identity and
Access Management (IAM), and you will administer IAM for resources.
Next, we’ll cover the different data storage services in Google Cloud, and you will implement
some of those services. Then, we’ll go over resource management, where you will manage and
examine billing of Google Cloud resources. Lastly, we’ll talk about resource monitoring, and you
will monitor Google Cloud resources using Google Cloud’s operations suite. Here are the
modules of the course:

  1. [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](#type)
  1. [Data Storage Services](#references)
  1. [Resource Management](#objects)
  1. [Resource Monitoring](#arrays) 

After you complete this course, I recommend enrolling in the Elastic Cloud Infrastructure:
Scaling and Automation course, which enhances your study of architecting with Compute
Engine with these modules:

1. Interconnecting Networks
2. Load Balancing and Autoscaling
3. Infrastructure Automation
4. Managed Services

Enjoy all of these courses!
